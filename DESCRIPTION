Description: Perform the complete processing of a set of proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra from the free induction decay (raw data) and based on a processing sequence (macro-command file). An additional file specifies all the spectra to be considered by associating their sample code as well as the levels of experimental factors to which they belong.
